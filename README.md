storage manager
This module is capable of reading blocks from a file on disk into memory and writing blocks from memory to a file on disk. The storage manager deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size (PAGE_SIZE). In addition to reading and writing pages from a file, it provides methods for creating, opening, and closing files.
